# Λ_LAMBDA LINKS_Λ

## Q. Why did I start this?

### A. Mainly to help others but also during my time so far at Lambda School I : 
*  ...didn't have instant recall of where I found a solution so I could revisit or explain how I accomplished a thing.
*  ...was trying to teach someone a thing when I should have shared a link to how I learned that thing.
*  ...lost my own work not rememebring in which sandbox I was working at that particular project.
*  ...took much longer to find a reference during a sprint because I had to google something and forgot the exact query.
*  ...wished I had saved bookmarks by when I used them instead of by subject because they built up fast in areas and overlap was an issue.
*  ...found many links I needed a a certain time became redundant or inconsequential later either because I mastered the thing or the concept was no longer needed.
*  ...discovered not having a link plan resulted in an unhelpful mess.

## What are the benefits?

*  Possibility to create a web app to find most used links and at what time in syllabus so future students can benefit.
*  Ability to throw links into a folder without worrying about organizing, losing, or creating disorder.
*  Seeking and sharing is enhanced especially if a web app is developed.
*  Ease of finding links you need during a sprint.
*  Opening a discussion about organisation and work processes is an underdeveloped student skill especially with new students and those without friends.
*  Helping students with organisation may result in:
      1. Reduced stress and student retention.
      1. Increased learning potential.
      1. More successful testing and progression.
      1. Facilitated sharing and camaraderie.

# The Way This Works

1. User can download the file as a zip by pressing the code button and downloading as a .zip file.
![shows where the link to download is](https://github.com/somersgreg/Lambda-Links/blob/master/github%20code%20link.com.png)
1. User can open the zip and drag the .html file to desktop or a temp folder.
1. User goes to browser of choice and Imports Bookmarks or Favorites as an HTML.
1. User then can drag current working Unit sub folder forward in directory from the DORMANT folder for easy access while learning in that unit.
1. Replace Unit folder when Unit is completed.

### I wish to stress that nothing bad will happen by downloading these links. They can be easily deleted from any browser by right clicking on the top folder and sending to trash.
### I've included several links that I thought were most useful to new students.
### I'm hoping for feedback about that and anything else that might come up.
#### Different browsers will force rename the top folder.  I can't figure out how to stop this.  Help wanted. Preferred Top title is ' Λ_LAMBDA LINKS_Λ ' just because it uses a lambda symbol as the first character which can help in several ways. 
Im interested to learn how each browser handles the top folder so I can make it better so if anyone can test that would be super helpful. 

Thank you and I hope this helps someone.
