# Lambda-Bookmark-Structure

This is intended to represent just an *idea* of how one might better organize their bookmarks collected during Lambda School.
It may be completely boneheaded but it could develop into something better with some collaboration.
Im always interested in finding better ways to do things and I dont assume my methods are correct but I have found it to be a problem.
The idea of creating Notion.so bookmark pages might be better but I dont know how. :( 
The links initially included are just examples but some I consider vital.
