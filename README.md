# Lambda-Links

Import this .html file to your browser and get a imo decent way to organize links while attending Lambda. 
As a optional practice you can create a Bookmarks folder on the cloud or locally to save a backup of your current links just in case anything ever happens.
Nothing bad should happen by importing this file.  It will just add a new bookmark or favorites directory with our course structure outline. The name of that directory might be "Lambda Links" or some generic name.  
Im interested to learn how each browser handles that so I can make it better so if anyone can test that would be super helpful. 

Thank you and I hope this helps someone.
